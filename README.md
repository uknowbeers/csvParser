# csvParser
Parse CSV files

For the files in CSV format, write a program in a language that makes
sense to you that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by insurance company in its own
file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending).Â  Lastly, if there are
duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record with the highest version should
be included. The following data points are included in the file:
- User Id (string)
- First Name (string)
- Last Name (string)
- Version (integer)
- Insurance Company (string)
